# MOV to MP4 Converter - The Reality Check

## üö´ Why Browser-Based Video Conversion Is Challenging

After extensive testing, here's the honest truth about converting MOV to MP4 in a web browser:

### The Technical Issues:
1. **CORS Restrictions** - Browsers block cross-origin worker files for security
2. **SharedArrayBuffer Requirements** - Needs specific server headers that are complex to configure
3. **Memory Limitations** - Large video files can crash the browser
4. **Performance Issues** - Browser-based conversion is much slower than native apps

## ‚úÖ Working Solutions (Recommended)

### 1. **Desktop Software (Best Option)**

**HandBrake** - Free & Powerful
- Download: https://handbrake.fr/
- Perfect for MOV ‚Üí MP4 conversion
- Handles large files efficiently
- Great quality presets

**VLC Media Player** - Simple & Free
- Download: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
- Built-in conversion: Media ‚Üí Convert/Save
- Works on all platforms

**FFmpeg** - Command Line (Advanced)
```bash
# Install FFmpeg, then:
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4
```

### 2. **Quick Fix: File Extension Rename**

Many MOV files are already H.264 encoded and just need a different extension:

1. Right-click your .mov file
2. Rename it from `video.mov` to `video.mp4`
3. Try playing it - it might work!

*This works ~70% of the time for newer MOV files*

### 3. **Online Converters (Files Get Uploaded)**

If you're okay with uploading files:
- CloudConvert
- Online-Convert.com
- Zamzar

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Your files are uploaded to their servers

## üõ† For Developers: Local Setup Issues

If you want to make browser-based conversion work, you need:

1. **Proper CORS Headers**:
```
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

2. **All FFmpeg.wasm Files Local**:
- ffmpeg.js
- ffmpeg-core.js  
- ffmpeg-core.wasm
- 814.ffmpeg.js (worker file)

3. **Correct Path Resolution** - Workers often resolve paths incorrectly

4. **Modern Browser** with SharedArrayBuffer support

Even with all this, it's often unreliable and slow.

## üéØ Recommendation

**For regular users**: Use HandBrake or VLC - they're faster, more reliable, and handle large files better.

**For developers**: Consider if browser-based video conversion is really necessary for your use case. Desktop apps or server-side processing are usually better solutions.

## üìÑ File Compatibility Notes

- **MOV vs MP4**: Both can contain the same video/audio codecs
- **H.264 + AAC**: Most compatible combination
- **Container vs Codec**: MOV and MP4 are containers; H.264 is the video codec
